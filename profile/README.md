QuecPython, inherited from microPython, provides python programming capability for Quectel's IoT modules. It aims to help developers complete project development quickly.

All of QuecPython's software, relating to the various series of Quectel's IoT modules, are available on this GitHub site. To check out all the series of Quectel's IoT modules, please visit [https://python.quectel.com](https://python.quectel.com).

Below you can find a selection of QuecPython's open-source projects. Our full repository list can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/QuecPython/repositories).

## Project Highlight

### Solutions

- **DTU** -  To accommodate various application scenarios, three different DTU solutions have been developed:
    - [Full-featured DTU](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-DTU) - Supports cloud connecting via multiple protocols like MQTT/HTTP/TCP/UDP, and it's allowed to set the configurations via [DTU-tool](https://github.com/QuecPython/DTU-tool).
    - [Simple DTU](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-simple-DTU) - A simplified DTU solution only supporting raw transmission over TCP/UDP, the configurations is fixed.
    - [Minimal DTU](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-minimal-DTU) - A minimal DTU with extremely simple software implementation which also only supports raw transmission over TCP/UDP, the configurations is fixed.
- **[Smart Tracker](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-tracker)** - The v2.0 branch offers a full-featured version, whereas the v1.0 branch provides a more lightweight baseline with a simpler set of functionalities.
- **[Wearable Solution](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-wearable)** - Solution for the wearable devices like watch.
- **[Electricity Meter](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-electricity-meter)** - A solution for electricity meters that supports the RFC1662 protocol, among others.
- **[Smart Agriculture Central Control Panel](https://github.com/QuecPython/solution-Agriculture-Control-Panel)** -  Offers a prototype design solution for smart agriculture central control panels, utilizing LVGL for graphical interface rendering.

### Drivers
- **[drivers](https://github.com/quecpython/drivers)** - A collection of driver code and reference manuals for various peripherals based on QuecPython.

### Components
- **[QFrame](https://github.com/QuecPython/QFrame)** - A QuecPython-based application framework.
- **[OCPP-v1.6](https://github.com/QuecPython/OCPP-v1.6)** - Electric Vehicle Charging Station Communication Protocol.
- **[AIS-140](https://github.com/QuecPython/AIS-140)** - Indian Automotive Location Device Communication Protocol.
- **[jtt808](https://github.com/QuecPython/jtt808)** - Chinese Automotive Location Device Communication Protocol.
- **[gt06](https://github.com/QuecPython/gt06)** - Communication Protocol between GPS positioning devices (such as vehicle trackers or other telematics devices) and servers.
- **[snmp](https://github.com/QuecPython/snmp)** - Simple Network Management Protocol, supporting versions v1, v2 and v3.
- **[uwebsocket](https://github.com/QuecPython/uwebsocket)** - WebSocket Protocol.
- **[watch_dog](https://github.com/QuecPython/watch_dog)** - Watchdog framework based on a voting mechanism, allowing each thread to have an independent software watchdog; through voting, the hardware watchdog decides whether to feed or not.
